       "> \n",
       "> \n",
       "> 2. **Preprocess the Dataset**:\n",
       ">    - Resize and crop the raster images to a consistent size.\n",
       ">    - Convert the vector images to a suitable format, such as SVG or EPS.\n",
       ">    - Normalize the pixel values of the raster images to improve training stability.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> \n",
       "> 3. **Choose an Appropriate Model Architecture**:\n",
       ">    - Consider using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, such as ResNet or VGGNet, as the backbone for your model.\n",
       ">    - Add additional layers on top of the CNN to extract high-level features and generate the vector image representation.\n",

       "> \n",
       "> \n",

       ">    - Use a combination of loss functions to encourage the model to produce vector images that are both visually similar and semantically meaningful to the input raster images.\n",
       ">    - Common loss functions include the mean squared error (MSE) or L1 loss for pixel-wise reconstruction, and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) or peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for image quality assessment.\n",
       ">    - Select an optimizer, such as Adam or RMSProp, to minimize the loss function during training.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> \n",
       "> 5. **Train the Model**:\n",
       ">    - Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.\n",
       ">    - Train the model on the training set using mini-batches of images.\n",
       ">    - Regularly evaluate the model's performance on the validation set to monitor its progress and prevent overfitting.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> \n",
       "> 6. **Fine-tune the Model**:\n",
       ">    - Once the model has converged, consider fine-tuning it on a specific dataset or domain.\n",
       ">    - Fine-tuning involves transferring the knowledge learned from the general dataset to a new, more specific task.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> \n",
       "> 7. **Evaluate the Model**:\n",
       ">    - Evaluate the trained model thoroughly on the test set to assess its generalization performance.\n",
       ">    - Use various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to measure the model's ability to generate high-quality vector images.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> \n",
       "> 8. **Deploy the Model**:\n",
       ">    - Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it into production.\n",
