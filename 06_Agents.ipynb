      "The musical focuses on Cady Heron, a teenage girl who transfers to a public high school after being homeschooled her whole life in Africa. At school, she befriends outsiders Janis Sarkisian and Damian Hubbard who persuades her to infiltrate the \"Plastics\", a clique consisting of wealthy but insecure Gretchen Wieners, sweet but dimwitted Karen Smith, and \"queen bee\" Regina George.\n",
      "Directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw, and produced by Lorne Michaels, the original production of Mean Girls premiered on Broadway at the August Wilson Theatre in 2018, after completing pre-Broadway tryouts in Washington, D.C. at the National Theatre in 2017. The show received positive to mixed reviews from critics and was nominated for twelve awards at the 72nd Tony Awards, including Best Musical. A recording featuring the original Broadway cast was released in 2018 by Atlantic Records. The show closed after 833 performances on Broadway on March 11, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.A film adaptation was released in theaters in January 2024.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Summary: In mathematics, a percentage (from Latin  per centum 'by a hundred') is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. It is often denoted using the percent sign (%), although the abbreviations pct., pct, and sometimes pc are also used. A percentage is a dimensionless number (pure number), primarily used for expressing proportions, but percent is nonetheless a unit of measurement in its orthography and usage.\n",

      "Page: Relative change\n",
      "Summary: In any quantitative science, the terms relative change and relative difference are used to compare two quantities while taking into account the \"sizes\" of the things being compared, i.e. dividing by a standard or reference or starting value. The comparison is expressed as a ratio and is a unitless number. By multiplying these ratios by 100 they can be expressed as percentages so the terms percentage change, percent(age) difference, or relative percentage difference are also commonly used. The terms \"change\" and \"difference\" are used interchangeably.Relative change is often used as a quantitative indicator of quality assurance and quality control for repeated measurements where the outcomes are expected to be the same. A special case of percent change (relative change expressed as a percentage) called percent error occurs in measuring situations where the reference value is the accepted or actual value (perhaps theoretically determined) and the value being compared to it is experimentally determined (by measurement).\n",
      "The relative change formula is not well-behaved under many conditions. Various alternative formulas, called indicators of relative change, have been proposed in the literature. Several authors have found log change and log points to be satisfactory indicators, but these have not seen widespread use.\n",

      "Participating teams have to register squads for each edition of the World Cup, which consisted of 22 players until 1998, of 23 players from 2002 to 2018, and of 26 players in 2022. Since 1978, winners' medals are given to all members of the winning squads. Prior to that, only players who were on the pitch during the final matches (or the de facto final in 1950) received medals. FIFA decided in 2007 to retroactively award winners' medals to all members of the winning squads between 1930 and 1974.World Cup winning players and managers are among a selected few who are officially allowed to touch the FIFA World Cup Trophy with bare hands, the group also including heads of state and FIFA officials.\n",

      "Summary: The World Cup is a solid gold trophy that is awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup association football tournament. Since the advent of the World Cup in 1930, two different trophies have been used: the Jules Rimet Trophy from 1930 to 1970 and thereafter the FIFA World Cup Trophy from 1974 to the present day. The current trophy is one of the most expensive trophies in sporting history and is valued at $20,000,000.The first trophy, originally named Victory, but later renamed in honour of FIFA president Jules Rimet, was made of gold plated sterling silver and a lapis lazuli base. It depicted Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. Brazil was awarded the trophy in perpetuity following their third title in 1970, prompting the commissioning of a replacement. The original Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered.\n",

      "Summary: The 2018 FIFA World Cup final was the final match of the 2018 World Cup, the 21st edition of FIFA's competition for national football teams. The match was played at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia, on 15 July 2018, and was contested by France and Croatia. The tournament comprised hosts Russia and 31 other teams who emerged from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, France finished first in Group C, with two wins and a draw, after which they defeated Argentina in the round of 16, Uruguay in the quarter-final and Belgium in the semi-final. Croatia finished top of Group D with three wins, before defeating Denmark in the round of 16 and Russia in the quarter-final â both through a penalty shoot-out â and then England in the semi-final. The final took place in front of 78,011 supporters, with more than a billion watching on television, and was refereed by NÃ©stor Pitana from Argentina.\n",
      "France took the lead through a controversial free kick that led to an own goal by Mario MandÅ¾ukiÄ in the 18th minute â the first ever own goal in a World Cup final â before Ivan PeriÅ¡iÄ equalised 10 minutes later with a low shot into the corner of the goal. Shortly afterwards, France were awarded a penalty when Pitana ruled that PeriÅ¡iÄ had deliberately handled the ball. The decision resulted from a consultation with the video assistant referee, which was in use for the first time in a World Cup at the 2018 tournament. The decision was criticised by some pundits such as Alan Shearer, who labelled it \"ridiculous\", while others such as Chris Waddle thought it was correct. Antoine Griezmann scored to give France a 2â1 half-time lead. They extended that lead in the 59th minute, when Paul Pogba scored at the second attempt after Croatia goalkeeper Danijel SubaÅ¡iÄ had saved his initial shot. Kylian MbappÃ© scored from outside the penalty area to make it 4â1, becoming only the second teenager to score in a World Cup final after PelÃ© in 1958, before MandÅ¾ukiÄ capitalized on a Hugo Lloris error to score a second for Croatia, giving a final score of 4â2 to France.\n",
      "France's win was their second World Cup title, following their victory in 1998, which they hosted. Griezmann was named the man of the match, while Croatia's Luka ModriÄ was awarded the Golden Ball as FIFA's outstanding player of the tournament. The final was the highest-scoring World Cup final since 1966. France's manager, Didier Deschamps, reflected on his own experience as captain of the 1998 French team, saying \"that adventure is linked to these players' adventure. I had the immense privilege to live through this 20 years ago, and in France, but what the players have just done is just as beautiful, just as powerful.\" His Croatian counterpart, Zlatko DaliÄ, congratulated France on their win, but was critical of the penalty decision, saying \"you donât give a penalty like that in a World Cup final\". At the subsequent UEFA Euro 2020 tournament, held in 2021, both France and Croatia reached the round of 16, before being eliminated by Switzerland and Spain respectively.\n",
      "The 2018 FIFA World Cup final was the first (and as of 2022, the most recent) final since 2002 not to go into extra time or penalties.\n",
